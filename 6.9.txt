The 1st locker will only be opened once and never touched again.
The 2nd (2^1) will be opened and closed exactly once.
The 3rd (3^1) locker as well.
It's apparent that every prime-numbered locker will be open.
The 4th (2^2) will be opened, closed (in the 2nd run) and then opened again (in the 4th run).
The 6th will be opened, closed in the 2nd run, opened in the 3rd run and closed in the 6th run.

Therefore, the locker will be open if its number of divisors is odd.

However, every divisor has a pair, except possibly the exact square root. So,
the only opened lockers are numbered by perfect squares.

Those are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81 and 100. 10 numbers.
