If p is 1 or 0, it trivially doesn't matter.

The probability of scoring two of three baskets for non-integer probability p is:

p * p * (1-p) * (3! / (2! * 1!)) = (p^2 - p^3) * 3

The probability of scoring three baskets is p^3.

So, it's only worth picking game 1 if

p > 3 * p^2 - 2 * p^3

, whose non-trivial root is 0.5.

If p > 0.5, game 2 is better. If p < 0.5, game 1 is better.
