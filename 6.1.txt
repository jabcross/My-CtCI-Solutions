Identify the bottles from 1 to 20. In the scale, measure, all together:

1 pill from bottle 1
2 pills from bottle 2
3 pills from bottle 3

and so on.

If all pills weighted 1.0 gram, you would expect 1 + 2 + ... + 19 + 20 = 210$ grams.

Since some bottle k has pills that weight an extra 0.1 gram, and you measured k of these pills, the measured value will be 210 + k * 0.1.

As such, if the measured value was m grams, the number of the bottle with heavier pills is (m - 210) * 10.
