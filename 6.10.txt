Let's do a binary search.

Number the test strips.

On the first day, test the first 512 sodas on strip 1.
On the second day, test the first 256 sodas of each previous partition on strip 2. (That is, bottle 1 to 256 and bottle 513 to 769).
On the third day, test the first halves of each of the partitions of the previous day (wether they were tested on or not).

Repeat until you are testing every other soda on strip 10.

This will basically give you the number, in binary, of the poisoned bottle, after 10 + 7 days (10 days for each test, 7 days for the last test to return.)

You could skip testing the sodas that were cleared after day 7.

This works because 10 bits can represent numbers from 0 to 1023, in which the number of bottles fits.
