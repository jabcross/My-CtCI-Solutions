I'd mantain a second value on each stack node, with the minimum value from this node until the root.

On push, we compare the new value with our top value's minimum.

* If greater than or equal, just push and copy the minimum.
* If smaller, set both the value and the minimum as the new value.

On pop, we just return the top value and destroy the node.

When calling min, we return the minimum value of the top node.
